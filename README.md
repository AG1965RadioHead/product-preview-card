# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

I used here:

1. Flexboxes a lot
2. Responsive design with @media to change flexbox direction from column to row
3. Hover at buy-btn with dark-green background0color
4. Different background images for mobile and desktop versions
